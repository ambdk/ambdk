- 👋 Hi, my name is Alexander
- 👨🏻‍✈️ I am a Commercial Pilot
- 🌏 I am based out of Denmark 🇩🇰
- 👨‍💻 I like to develop progressive web apps (PWA's) and just web apps in general.
- 📚 I’m currently learning the MERN stack, and in the future look at mobile development.
- 🔒 Currently all of my repositories are private due to not being open source, but will hopefully upload some open source material in the future.
- 👀 Using Visual Studio Code as my main editor.
- 🗓 Currently spending my time on developing the PWA for https://uniworth.app/

Have a great day.

Best regards,
Alexander
